	<h1 align="center">Welcome to Mile High Weights</h1>
	
 <br>

<br>
<p align="center">Looking for quality weights but are off put by how expensive metal weights have become?</p>
<br>
<p align="center">Did you know that prior to the COVID-19 global pandemic, about 95% of metal weights were produced in China?</p>
<p align="center">Mile High Weights has an answer for you.  We are selling competitively priced, and locally produced weights.  We are selling 45, 25 and 10 lbs weight plates.  Available in either Olympic or Standard barbell sizes</p>

	
<p align="center">We produce the weights with a crack-resistant blend of concrete, composed of a proprietary mixture that includes reinforcing fibers and metal mesh to increase strength and rigidity</p>
